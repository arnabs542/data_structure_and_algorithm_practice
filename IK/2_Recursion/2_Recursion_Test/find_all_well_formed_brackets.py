Find All Well Formed Brackets
Problem Statement:
Given a positive integer n, find ALL well formed round brackets string of length 2*n.
The purpose of this problem is to learn recursion and not DP. So, you must write at least one recursive solution. After
that, you can write a DP solution if you want.
Input/Output Format For The Function:
Input Format:
There is only one argument denoting integer n.
Output Format:
Return array of strings res, containing all possible well formed round brackets string. (Length of each string will be
2*n).
You need not to worry about the order of strings in res.
E.g. For n = 2, ["(())", "()()"] or ["()()", "(())"], both will be accepted.

Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:
Input Format:
There should be one line for input, containing an integer n.
If n = 3, then input should be:
3

Output Format:
Letâ€™s denote the size of res is m, where res is the resultant array of string returned by the solution function.
Then, there will be m lines of output, where ith line contains res[i], denoting string at index i of res.

For input n = 3, output will be:
((()))
(()())
(())()
()(())
()()()

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 13
Only use round brackets. '(' and ')'.
Sample Test Case:
Sample Input:
3
Sample Output:
[
   "((()))",
   "(()())",
   "(())()",
   "()(())",
   "()()()"
]

(This is one of the possible outputs. Array containing these five string in any order, will be accepted.)
