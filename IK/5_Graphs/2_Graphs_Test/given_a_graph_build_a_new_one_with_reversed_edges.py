'''
Given A Graph, Build A New One With Reversed Edges
Problem Statement:
Given a strongly connected directed graph G, containing n nodes and m edges, you have to build a new graph containing n
 nodes, where edges are reversed than the original graph G.
This is also called Transposing the graph.
Input/Output Format For The Function:
Input Format:
There is only one argument pointing to a random node of the graph G.
Output Format:
Return any node in the new graph.
As input is a strongly connected graph, you will be able to visit all the nodes, given any random node.
Also when we reverse all the edges of strongly connected graph it will remain strongly connected graph, hence returning
 any one node is sufficient.
Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:
Input Format:
The first line of input should contain two space separated integers n and m, denoting no. of nodes and no. of edges in input
 graph G. In next m lines, each line should contain two space separated integers fromNode and toNode, denoting that there
 is an edge from fromNode to toNode in G.
If n = 3, m = 3 and edges = [(1 -> 2), (2 -> 3), (3 -> 1)], then input should be:
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
Output Format:
There will be one line of output, containing a string "Wrong Answer!" OR "Correct Answer!", depending on the evaluation
 of your solutionâ€™s output.
For input n = 3, m = 3 and edges = [(1 -> 2), (2 -> 3), (3 -> 1)], if your solution is correct, output will be:
Correct Answer!
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 315
Given graph does not contain multi edges (there will not be more than one edge connecting same pair of vertices
 in the same direction) and self loops.
Each node contains distinct values.
1 <= value stored in node <= n
You are not allowed
 to modify the given graph. Return completely new graph.
Sample Test Case:
Sample Input:
Any node of the graph where:
For n = 3
nodes = [1 2 3]
edges = [(1 -> 2), (2 -> 3), (3 -> 1)]
you could be given any node (1, 2 or 3) as input.
Sample Output:
Any node of the new graph where:
For n = 3
nodes = [1 2 3]
edges = [(2 -> 1), (3 -> 2), (1 -> 3)]
you could return any node as output.
Notes:
Maximum time allowed in interview: 20 Minutes.

'''
To solve this problem simple DFS will work! 
Code provided by will be enough to understand the idea.
Time Complexity:
As we are doing normal DFS time complexity of our solution will be O(V + E). We are given n nodes and also given that it
 does not contain multiple edges and self loops hence maximum number of edges possible is n * (n - 1). So time complexity
 will be O(n + n^2) that is O(n^2).
Space complexity:
Given input contains O(n^2) edges and we are also creating new graph with O(n^2) edges hence space complexity will be O(n^2).
